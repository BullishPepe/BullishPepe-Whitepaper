**The BullishPepe token offers a distinctive feature known as **<mark style="color:green;">**USDT reflections**</mark>**, which distinguishes it from other meme tokens. This feature allows token holders to earn rewards simply by holding their BullishPepe tokens in their wallets. The USDT reflections feature works in such a way that all transactions on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) network with the BullishPepe token are subjected to a **<mark style="color:green;">**7% fee**</mark>**. Out of this fee, **<mark style="color:green;">**4% is automatically rewarded**</mark>** to all existing BullishPepe token holders in the form of USDT tokens, which are directly deposited into their wallets. This feature has made BullishPepe not only a fun and community-driven token but also a potentially lucrative one, as token holders can earn rewards while they wait for the value of the token to appreciate. Moreover, with a total supply of **<mark style="color:green;">**1,000,000,000,000**</mark>**, the token is widely available for investors and traders to participate in, boosting its overall liquidity and investment opportunities. The USDT reflections mechanism also adds stability to the token's price, as more rewards from the feature bring more demand for the token, and this, in turn, increases its overall value.**
