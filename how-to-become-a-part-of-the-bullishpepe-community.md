**To get started with BullishPepe, all one needs is a wallet to hold their tokens. The most commonly used wallet for crypto is Metamask. Users can download the **<mark style="color:green;">**Metamask**</mark>** app from the App Store or Google Play Store onto their mobile device, or they can use the browser extension on their desktop, which can be downloaded from metamask.io.**

**After setting up a wallet, the next step is to stock up on BNB, which is the native token of the Binance Smart Chain ecosystem. Users can purchase BNB in various ways, including buying it directly on Metamask, transferring from another wallet, or buying it on another exchange and sending it to their wallet.**

**Once users have acquired BNB, they can go to PancakeSwap and connect their wallet. **<mark style="color:green;">**PancakeSwap**</mark>** is the most popular decentralized exchange on the Binance Smart Chain ecosystem, allowing users to swap their BNB for BullishPepe, which is represented by the symbol $BPP. To swap BNB for $BPP, set the **<mark style="color:green;">**slippage to 10%**</mark>** in the options menu, and voila, users are now the proud holders of BullishPepe meme tokens.**
